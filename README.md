### Overview

> Questions that Stalker answers:
- How is the market that the company is in evolving through the last years?
- What is the sentiment about the company and founders in twitter and recent news?
- What information about the company and founder can I gather from tech database? (Crunchbase and others)
- Is there something worrying about the company or founder on the internet?

> Relevance of the project 

This tool eases the process of due dilligence for tech investors cutting the time it takes to validate a project and team and thus reducing the time needed to close a deal.  

> Null Hypothesis: 

 - The market the startup is in is growing.
 - The founder and company have good reputation.


> Data considerations
 
 - I started by asking myself what data I would like to have and asking some Angel Investors what data they would like to have. After that, I tried to find the resources that gave me that data. 

> How the hypothesis is tested:

 - Analizing data about the amount of money invested in the sector and the number of deals done in the recent years and predicting future movements.
 - Trying to find information about the founders on the internet and social media.

> How the success is tested: 
 - The tool is correctly doing it's work if it is able to find meaningful information.
